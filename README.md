# 🏔️ EcoTrail: Smart Eco-Tourism Trail Guide
https://ecotrail-949y.onrender.com/



**Tackling Problem Statement 1.1** | Built for Himachal Pradesh

EcoTrail is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to protect both tourists and the fragile ecosystems of high-altitude trails. By turning 1.7 crore annual tourists into a live sensor network, EcoTrail bridges the gap between fragmented safety data, unmonitored crowds, and broken environmental feedback loops.

---

## 🚨 The Problem
High-altitude tourism currently operates in the dark, leading to preventable accidents and severe ecological degradation:
* **Zero Real-Time Safety:** Trails lack live data on landslide-prone zones and sudden weather hazards.
* **Blind Overcrowding:** Massive tourist influxes happen with no density alerts or capacity management.
* **Broken Feedback Loop:** Hazard zones, infrastructure damage, and waste accumulation go unreported for weeks.

## 💡 The Solution: See it. Know it. Report it.
EcoTrail replaces fragmented systems with a single, comprehensive ecosystem for the conscious traveler.

### ✨ Core Features

#### 🗺️ 1. Live Safety Map
A custom interactive map interface built to keep hikers aware of their immediate surroundings.
* **Real-Time Overlays:** Live AQI data and weather metrics.
* **Dynamic Hazard Zones:** Visual indicators for dangerous areas and trail blockages.
* **Interactive Toggles:** Users can switch between safety, crowd density, and environmental impact layers.

#### 🤖 2. EcoBot AI (Multi-Agent RAG Pipeline)
A highly advanced, context-aware AI assistant designed to answer trail-specific questions without hallucinations.
* **Powered by Google Gemini & Pinecone:** Utilizes a robust Vector Database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
* **Multi-Agent Architecture:** A custom router classifies user intent to trigger specialized agents (Trail Safety, Eco-Policy, or Live Data).
* **Instant Answers:** Provides grounded guidelines on local eco-rules and emergency protocols.

#### ♻️ 3. The Ecosystem
* **One-Tap SOS:** Instantly pings local authorities with precise GPS coordinates, bypassing standard rural response delays.
* **Gamified Leaderboard:** Rewards tourists with points for reporting trail hazards, clearing waste, and maintaining ecological hygiene.
* **Community Impact Dashboard:** A public tracker showing total hazards resolved and trails cleaned by the EcoTrail community.
